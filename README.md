# Labubu Mini Game & Chibi Chat Game

Two fun Python Pygame projects bundled together:

- **Chibi Chat Game:** The main menu and chat interface where you can start the real time usi API with Chibi .
- **Labubu Mini Game:** A cute Labubu-inspired platformer with movement, shooting, and a back button to return to the menu.

## Features

- Simple controls: arrow keys to move, X to ready weapon, SPACE to shoot, R to reload, and P to pause.
- Back button to navigate between the chat/menu and the mini game.
- Basic enemy AI with ram and psycho rodent enemies.
- Health and ammo HUD for player status.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Install Pygame if you don't have it yet:
3. Run the chat game script (`main_game.py`) to launch the main menu.
4. Click "Let's go" in the menu to start the Labubu mini game.
5. Use the back button in-game to return to the main menu.

## Assets

- Include any image or audio assets in the same folder as the scripts.
- If assets are missing, the game will fallback to simple shapes and no sound.

## Notes

- This project is a fun exploration of Pygame basics and simple game mechanics.
- Feel free to modify, expand, or use parts in your own projects!
- I used API for real chat (Deepseek model)
